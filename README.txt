This program is a command-line file management tool for checking the contents of a directory. It has many options that let you list only files, or all files and subdirectories recursively, and so on.  The results/output of this code are presented in files first, followed by directories, making it easy for you to understand and read. 

The program also offers options to help you find a specific file in the directory or its subdirectories. It also helps you filter files by file extension. It keeps running until the user types the “Q” command to exit. This tool uses the pathlib module to demonstrate basic directory browsing, file handling, and file searching.
